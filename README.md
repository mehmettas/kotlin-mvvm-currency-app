<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]()

Cent, gives you the ability to view all the currency rates by daily datas based on specific currency. When you first open up the application, you'll see all world currency rates against one currency. You could change this base currency on the top right base button. You could easily go to the detail of the selected currency and have the detailed data with line chart in the intervals of: last one week, one month, one year and five year.

While developing this project, I have used [Foreign exchange rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) where I can retrieve the latest rates data based on the parameters such like; time interval, against to a base currency, with symbols(currency) and the data. The manipulation of the data made by me. I did some calculations that the API doesn't provide.
